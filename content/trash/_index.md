I got involved with local neighborhood clean ups in Nob Hill through Refuse Refuse. I started picking up trash on my own because I actually find it fun in a way, and meditative. I also get a lot of fulfillment out of people saying thank you to me for helping to keep the neighborhood clean. As small as it is, I do feel like I am helping accomplish something, and I am proud of it. I am posting logs of the picked up trash to help catalogue my overall impact through time.

These are the images I sent on the SF 311 app to ask the city to come pick up this collected trash. I find that they are actually very responsive, so I am very grateful for the quick functioning of this aspect of the government.
