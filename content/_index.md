### About Me 
Hello! I'm Zach. I'm a software engineer in Santa Clara, CA. When I have spare brain capacity my hobbies include programming, 3D printing, and robotics. Otherwise, I enjoy people, TV, and video games.



#### Currently 
I currently work at OnePointOne, Inc, a startup building a fully automated indoor vertical farming system. I specifically work on the image processing subsystem using digital signal processing, machine learning, & deep learning. I also do some backend work to get everything connected.
