### About Me 
Hello! I'm Zach. I'm a software engineer in San Francisco, CA. When I have spare brain capacity my hobbies include programming, 3D printing, and robotics. Otherwise, I enjoy people, TV, and video games.



#### Currently 
Currently I am in-between jobs! I was laid off by OnePointOne, Inc. If you're looking for someone to help you with computer vision related tasks or backend related tasks, shoot me an email at zbellay at gmail dot com!
