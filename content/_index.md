### About Me 
Hello! I'm Zach. I'm a software engineer in San Francisco, CA. I enjoy programming and building websites and mobile apps. My long-term goal is to build products that people love. Aside from coding, you might otherwise find me enjoying friendship at bars, restaurants, cafes, or parks in San Francisco.

#### Currently 
Currently I am a full-stack engineer at Rinse. I work on mobile, web frontend, and backend. I derive great joy from delivering value to end users and putting smiles on their faces.
