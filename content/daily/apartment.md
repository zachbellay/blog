Hi! My name is Zach Bellay, I'm 26, I'm looking for 2 male roommates to live with at 1369 Hyde St. The lease would be a 12 month lease that starts March 1, 2024. I work remote as a software engineer, and have been living here for 2.5 years. My roommates are leaving, one to New York, another to Florida, but I love this place and since it's a great deal I want to keep it.

Furniture won't all be the same since, and I'm happy to redecorate and move things around.

If you're interested in the place, I can show you around or send more pictures. Email me at <a href="mailto:zbellay@gmail.com">zbellay@gmail.com</a>
