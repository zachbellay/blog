Americans are lonely these days. Many of us spend at least 8 hours a day on screens for work. Then after work, we spend even more time on our phone, personal computer, TV, or gaming device to recover and entertain ourselves. At least in my world, it's not uncommon for most people I know to spend their entire day in front of a screen with the exception of taking care of other biological needs (eating, bathing, excercise, etc.).

Why do we do this to ourselves? The first answer may be, well I need to work a job so I can eat, have a place to sleep, and pay my utilities. 

The system tears apart communities and groups to the point where the only people we interact with are service workers who service our needs only in a transactional capacity. For lots of people, if they even have any social interaction that interaction is with a cashier at a grocery store, or a clerk at a gas station, or a barista getting coffee. 

Furthermore, the American way of life promotes separating children from their families once they are of age. Usually the American ritual involves sending young adults to college away from home. This is then used to normalized not living with their parents. Which in one aspect can be seen as the young birds being pushed out of the nest so they can learn to fly. But on the other hand can be viewed as encouraging the young to disregard their family once they leave the nest.
