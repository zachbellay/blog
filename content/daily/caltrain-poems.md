Discontent
Seemingly eternal
Relief, only breifly
Is it me? Or is this our lot?
When do we get there?
When do we arrive?
In my mind soon
But I know
Not really

---

When is a man happy?
There is a set of conditions
that make a man happy
Things happen, chemicals flow
Is that it?
You're telling me I'm just chemicals?
Maybe
I doubt it

--- 

I won!
After much hard work
sacrifice
and pain
The fruits of my labour
Ripe
I did it myself
Born in the USA
