I recently heard a podcast about a man (who I presumed was black or latino) making less than minimum wage driving for Doordash. The worst part about this is that he had a child. There are so many things wrong with this man, with society, and with how humans are built. Allow me to rantsplain.

### The Man

This man has poor economic prospects, as is indicated by him making less than minimum wage. And yet, he still chooses to have a child. He *chose* to have another mouth to feed, when he can barely feed himself. Regardless of the ongoing abuse by gig working companies that puts this man in a situation where he makes $6.25/hr, it is borderline child abuse to willingly bring a child into a situation with such meagre prospects. 

Now I know what you're thinking. What if this man is a disadvantaged person who is merely doing his best in this ruthless world? Does he still not have the right to have children? Is he not entitled to have children? Wouldn't it be psuedo-eugenics based on economics propogated by corporations who are systemically racist to claim he shouldn't have children?

*Well*, hypothetical question asker... You are correct! He does in fact have the right to have children. No one is taking away his ability to procreate by forcibly castrating him. 

I would probably agree that saying this man shouldn't have children because he is poor is in fact a type of race based eugenics where economic strife is the means used to disincentivize procreation. That said, there is also the real life reality that he only makes so many dollars per day. Now don't get me wrong, I believe that this man is surely being exploited by being misclassified as an independent contractor by the ride share and delivery tech companies.

Ultimately, to me this is a pretty clear indication that our society is in a very unhealthy state. Why is it that a man can bust his ass and not even be able to get by? Society is failing this man, and we need to take action to reform our system to have more equitable outcomes.
