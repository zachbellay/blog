I've noticed that Hacker News comments tend to mention a lot of the same "laws", effects, and other things that succinctly explain ideas. Here are some of the most prevalent:

- **Goodhart's Law**: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

- **Parkinson's Law**: Work expands to fill the time it is alloted

- **Dunning Kruger Effect**: People with lesser competency in some area overestimate their abilities compared to someone with greater competency

- **Moore's Law**: The idea that semiconductor chip density doubles every two years. (dead)

- **Huang's Law**: GPU performance will double every two years (ongoing and alive! Jensen Huang is the current CEO of Nvidia)

- **Occam's Razor**: The simplest explanation is usually correct

- **Hanlon's Razor**: Never attribute to malice what which can be explained by incompetence/stupidity

- **Pareto Principle (AKA 80/20 Rule)**: 80% of output comes from 20% percent of source (for example 80% of campaign donations come from 20% of donors)

- **Murphy's Law**: What can go wrong will go wrong

- **Brook's Law**: Adding programmers to a late software project will only make it later

- **Conway's Law**: Software architecture is determined by organizational structure (e.g. a team split into backend/frontend teams will have a microservices based architecture, as opposed to monolithic)

- **Sturgeon's Law**: 90% of everything is crap

- **Chesterton's Fence**: If there is something that you want to get rid of that seemingly does nothing (like a fence, or a piece of code) but you don't know why it's there, you should think about why that thing might be there before you remove it
